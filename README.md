# Ασφάλεια Συστημάτων και Υπηρεσιών University Project

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the **"System and Service Security"** course at Technical University of Crete. The course covers a wide range of security concepts and practical implementations, divided into **seven projects**. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of system and network security, including cryptography, malware detection, web vulnerabilities, network monitoring, and exploitation techniques.

## 📚 Project Overview

The course is divided into **seven projects**, each addressing a critical area of system and service security:

### **Project 1: Cryptographic Methods**
1. **Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) Key Exchange**  
   - Implementation of ECDH for secure key exchange.
2. **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**  
   - Implementation of RSA for encryption and decryption.

### **Project 2: Access Control Logging**
- Design and implementation of an access control logging system to monitor and log user activities.

### **Project 3: Malware Detection Tool**
- Development of a Python-based malware detection tool using **signature-based scanning**.

### **Project 4: Web-Based Vulnerabilities & Attacks Exploitation**
- Exploration and exploitation of common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

### **Project 5: Network Traffic Monitoring with Packet Capture (C)**
- Implementation of a network traffic monitoring tool using the **Packet Capture (PCAP)** library in C.

### **Project 6: Network Traffic Monitoring with Snort**
- Configuration and use of the **Snort** intrusion detection system for network traffic analysis.

### **Project 7: Buffer Overflow Exploitation**
- Demonstration and exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
